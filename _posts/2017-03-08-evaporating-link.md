# Evaporating.Link

[Evaporating.Link][1] is a simple file sharing service hosted in the cloud.

Share your file in 3 easy steps, and you don't even have to worry about it hanging around.

1. Sign in to Google
2. Select a file to upload
3. Click upload

The link is then shown on the screen to be copied!

The file will be deleted after 1 day, so there is no need to worry about your files floating around forever.
Indexing of uploaded files has been blocked so they won't appear in search engines.

## Why

I was inspired by [txt.fyi](https://txt.fyi/), a service to share snippets of text permanently on the interwebs.

The concept behind [Evaporating.Link][1] was born by flipping this premise on it's head.
Temporarily store files on the interwebs.

Things like dropbox and Google Drive are great, but I harbour a lack of trust for closed source systems.
You will find the entire source code for [Evaporating.Link][1] on [Github](https://github.com/ScreamingHawk/evaporating-link).

I have so many accounts with third party file stores, I can't recall where everything is located and all of that stuff, I don't even know what is valuable anymore.
More than likely, none of it is valuable.

## What

Pure HTML, CSS and Javascript. Ê∞óÊåÅ„Å°~

I considered including [Evaporating.link][1] within this Jekyll site, but thought it would be nice to separate the two in case it takes off.
Given the decision to separate the site from the blog I figured I'd switch up the design a bit too and build a simple interface and trivial navigation.
I opted for my technology stack to reflected the interface design decisions and went with a pure web stack.

I'll create a walk through of the code and decisions made in another post.

## Where

In Amazon of course!

I'll do another write up that specifically talks about the architecture behind [Evaporating.Link][1].

## When

[Evaporating.Link][1] is live now!

It went live on the 7th of March 2017.

Total development time including design and infrastructural procurement was about 8 hours total.

## Who

I'm [Michael Standen]({{ site.url }}). The pretty guy on the home page üòâ
