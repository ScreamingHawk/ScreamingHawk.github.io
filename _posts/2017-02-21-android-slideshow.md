## Note from the Developer
I have a strange use case where I like to be able to have images scroll across my phone.
Since I've been meaning to create an Android application for the app store, I decided that this was a good enough application.

Given I've received a number of feature requests since releasing the application (on F-droid in particular), it seems to be appreciated.

## Description
Now you can view files on your devices with ease!

Quickly browse through your file system for the directory you want to view, click an image and the slideshow will automatically begin.

Great for showing off those vacation photos without having to scroll.

## Features
* Select any directory on your phone
* Automatically begins playing slideshow
* Tap to pause, then tap to resume
* Swipe left and right to skip
* Ability to delete images from within the slideshow
* Sequential or random display order
* Configurable delay
* Show / hide hidden files

## Un-Features
* No sign up
* No internet connection
* No requests to rate the app
* No trail periods
* No paid upgrades

## Upcoming Features and Feature Requests
All planned enhancements are here: https://github.com/ScreamingHawk/android-slideshow/labels/enhancement
