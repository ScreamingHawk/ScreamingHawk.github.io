# One Post a Day

Lately I've been doing a lot of introspection and have noticed that one of the things I really want is a collection of thoughts, feelings, and everyday life events that I can hand down to the family when I'm gone in order to give them a snapshot into my life.

I have no idea what content I will end up posting. I'm hoping a less structured approach will lead to something organic and interesting.

## Creating the Habit

I quickly identified that the only way I would be able to do this is if became a habit. To create the habit effectively I realised I needed to do the following:

* make it quick
* make it easy
* make it easy (mentally)
* link it to an existing habit

In order to **make it quick**, I decided to use a medium that lead itself to short format content. The ideal for this is social media. Something like [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) would be perfect. I would have loved it to be a part of this blog but blogging leads itself to long format posts.

To **make it easy (mentally)**, I decided there would be no rules about the kind of content I can post. Anything that comes to mind can be added. This reduces the mental load of completing the action and helps the habit form. Once I have a good grounding I might revisit this. I also decided that I wouldn't tie it to a specific time of day to ensure I can do it when inspiration strikes.

To **link it to an existing habit**, I looked at all the social media I usually use. I actually don't use a lot. Almost exclusively [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) and [Discord](https://discord.com/). Whenever I'm on the platform I will be cued to make my daily post. If I don't feel like doing it at the time, I'll surely open the app again later...

After posting the above I decided to make posting an activity I do while cooling down from a run. I feel very inspirational after a run, it's almost like meditating for me. The problem with this is that I don't run every day... I've had to stack it with other habits as well to be successful.

To **make it easy**, I realised I would need an automated process of collating the information and sticking it on a webpage. I've been doing a couple hobby projects with discord bots so that was an obvious choice.

Check out my other [post about habit formation]({% post_url 2019-01-22-habits %}) if you want more details about this process.

It's doubly important not to judge yourself when you've *failed* at your habit. So long as you can get back into the rhythm again you are succeeding. Making it as easy as possible to *succeed* is key. I'm not there yet but I'm consistent enough that I think this will stick.

## Automating the Process

Every so often I run a script that will hunt through a specific channel on Discord for my posts and write them to a file, then upload them to github where the web page is available.

I already have a bot and a Discord server so combining these with the little extra piece of functionality was easy.

One step further I would like to take is putting the script on a hosted machine that runs automatically. Right now I have to remember to run the script, which means the webpage doesn't get updated as frequently as I would like.
