Like every modern family, a lot of television (read: anime) is consumed in my household.

I have my computer connected directly to the TV in the lounge, which is used as a secondary monitor.
This makes it easy to watch any shows I have, using [VLC media player][0].

I'm lazy, and don't want to get out of my seat to click the `Play Next` button.
So, I built a companion application.

## Introducing [Web VLC][1].

### What is it tho?

[Web VLC][1] is a website that controls VLC on the host machine.

This means you can browse to the website on your phone and control VLC through a sexy interface.

It also has a bunch of features like:

* Beautiful sorted list of all your shows
* Show information from IMDB
* Seeking and volume control
* `Play Next` button for binge watching

## How can I use it?

Check the `README.md` of [the project][1] in case things have changed.

### Network configuration

Have your computer hooked up to the screen you would like to watch your movie on.
Connect your computer and your mobile devices to the same network.
Looks something like this:

</figure>

### VLC configuration

VLC must be configured to expose it's web API.

To do this, check the following setting.

1. `Tools > Preferences`
2. At the bottom for `Show settings`, check `All`
3. `Interface > Main interfaces`
4. Check the `web` checkbox
5. `Interface > Main interfaces > Lua`
6. Enter a password into `Lua HTTP > Password`. (This password goes into the app configuration below)
7. `Save`
8. Close and re-open VLC
9. Accept the network prompt if shown
10. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to see if it worked

### App configuration

Edit `server/config.yaml` with your defaults.

Ensure the `vlc.command` works in your console.

Copy the paths to your videos into `files.locations`.

### Video file structure

Files must be organised like so:

```
Show Name
	> Season x
		> video_episode_xx.ext
```

Season folder may be omitted.
The video name can be anything.

### Usage

Install dependencies.

```
npm i
```

Edit `server/config.yaml` with your defaults.

Build everything and run in a single command, because you are lazy.

```
npm run complete
```

Navigate to the application at `http://localhost:3000`.
Note your path may be different if you changed the config.

Get your computer's IP address and navigate to that from your mobile.

## End

Like all my projects, this is open source and bug reports / pull requests are greatly appreciated.

Enjoy!
