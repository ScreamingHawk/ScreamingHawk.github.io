## Why the new site?
I've had a number of big life events recently and thought to myself, what better way to celebrate than a website design!

Yes, I am that cool.

## Who are you anyway?
I'm a software engineer for [fun](https://github.com/{{ site.github }}) and [profit](https://linkedin.com/in/{{ site.linkedin }}).

## What's going to be on the site?
Whatever I feel like putting on.

I'm always working on something or another and constantly looking out for new innovations and life hacks.

This is going to become the primary place for posting. Bye bye [blogger](https://milkprojects.blogspot.co.nz/).

## When are you putting new stuff up?
When I feel like it.

You might be noticing a trend here. I'm a creature of whim that's bound with real world commitments and fickle desires.
I'll try to make all posts contain content. I won't just make posts for the sake of posting. This is about progress.

## Where can I find out more?
Best place to catch me is via [email](mailto:{{ site.email }}), alternatively you can check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/{{ site.github }}).


## How is the site made?
This is a Jekyll site that is generated and hosted in the AWS Cloud. I'll make a follow up post detailing the process I followed to set this up.

Nearly everything I make is in AWS so you are sure to see some posts in the future about it.
