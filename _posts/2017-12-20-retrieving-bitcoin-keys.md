## History

I wrote a guide previously about [how to access your private keys from your Android wallet][0], but times have moved on and it's due for an update.

This guide leverages a python script created by [jleni][1] to make the process super easy.

## Back Up Your Keys

**You should already be backing up your keys and know how to do this!**

But for completeness, here's how:

Open the app.

Open the `option menu` and select `Safety` then `Back up wallet`.

Give your wallet a good password. And I mean *really* good. If someone gets this back up, they have all your coins.

`Archive` your back up to somewhere you can access it from your PC.
I use [Evaporating.link][2] for temporary sharing and [Google Drive][3] for longer term.
I also recommend sticking the date on the filename.

## Download the Files

Download the script.

```
git clone https://github.com/jleni/wallet-decrypt.git
cd wallet-decrypt
```

Download and install `python` (preferably Python 3) from [the Python website][4].

Download and install `pip` from [the pip website][5].

Install the python dependencies.

```
sudo pip install pycryptodome
sudo pip install protobuf
```

### Optional Security

The script requires your password be entered into the command line.
This is poor security practice.

I recommend altering the script to contain your password instead of using the argument and then erase the script afterwards.

Replace `args.password` with your password in the following line:

```
w = get_wallet(args.filename, args.password)
```

**Don't forget to delete / restore the script after use.**

## Extract the BIP-39 Mnemonic

A [BIP-39 mnemonic][6] is generated by the script for each address.
This is essentially a human friendly version of your private key.

**Keep in mind that the mnemonic can be used to derive your private key so must be handled as securely as you would for your private key.**

Read that above line again! This is important.

Run your script against the file to obtain your mnemonic.

```
python wallet-decrypt.py <your_backup_file> <your_backup_password>
```

Where `<your_backup_file>` is the filename and `<your_backup_password>` is the file password.
If you replaced the password in the **Optional Security** step earlier, you can use anything in place of the password argument.

**Done!**

The script will output the mnemonic.
Be sure to keep this in a safe place.
